            The Unpaywall database has a very simple structure: we have one record for every article with a Crossref DOI (that's about 95 million records all told). We harvest from <router-link to="/sources">lots of sources</router-link> to find Open Access content, and then we match it to these DOIs using content fingerprints. So, for any given DOI, we know about any OA versions that exist anywhere (at least that's the idea).
        </p>
        <p>We support a variety of products to help folks access these 95 million records in different ways; all of these are free to use, except the <router-link to="/products/data-feed">Data Feed.</router-link> We also support a number of <router-link to="/integrations">integrations,</router-link> where other organizations have built useful tools on top of our dataset.

                Most of our enterprise users end up using the <router-link to="/products/data-feed">Data Feed</router-link> in order to keep their data up to date, and that's a good first stop. Other tools that are popular with enterprise users include:

                OA researchers can use Unpaywall to answer research questions about the current and historical state of open access.

                There are several popular ways  to access the data for research: you can use the
                                <router-link to="/products/api">REST API, </router-link>
                                <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roadoi/vignettes/intro.html"> the R API wrapper, </a>
                                <router-link to="/products/simple-query-tool">the Simple Query Tool, </router-link>
                                or
                                <router-link to="/products/snapshot">download the whole dataset.</router-link>

            </p>
            <p>


                A particularly easy way to get started with research is to use <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?and_facet_open_access=True">Dimensions</a> or
                                <a href="https://clarivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Clarivate-OA-Impact-Story_Intro-sheet.pdf?elqTrackId=c5abee7048934a3da317e296a3e2a9c8&elqaid=5350&elqat=2">Web of Science, </a> which both have Unpaywall data integrated into their databases. That's the approach used by
                                <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3520/">this recent paper.</a> You might also check out the
                                <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3119v1/">the canonical reference paper</a> for the dataset, which gives a good overview of the data as a whole.

                <strong>Institutional Repository managers</strong>
                can use Unpaywall data to find OA resources that faculty have posted online, without depositing in their IR. These can be automatically ingested, significantly increasing IR coverage without needing to convince faculty to deposit. Repositories of all sizes have used Unpaywall data in this way.  SwePub (national repository of Sweden) added 75,000 new OA records, increasing number of OA records by over 30%, while the smaller
                <a href="https://ir.library.carleton.ca/">the Carleton University IR</a> added 1000 OA records, doubling their fulltext coverage. There are a few good ways to access our data for this use case:
                <router-link to="/products/snapshot">download the whole dataset, </router-link>
                <router-link to="/products/simple-query-tool">check lists of records by DOI,</router-link> or
                taking advantage of Unpaywall's integration into the
                <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?and_facet_open_access=True">Dimensions</a> and
